		<h1>You have to realise that someday you will die…</h1><p>…until you know that, you are useless. That's part of the lyrics of <a href="http://www.leoslyrics.com/tyler-durden/this-is-your-life-lyrics/">This is your life</a>, part of the soundtrack to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight club film</a>, based on <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/books/fight-club">a book by Chuck Palahniuk</a>. It's a sentence I like to remember during the times when everything goes wrong: broken hardware, service providers going out of business, breaking relationships, etc. Focusing on whatever <span style="font-style: italic;">is gone</span> is the result of getting too attached, and that can interfere with new things in life. It simply means change, and people who are unable to change will have a harder time than those who can adapt.</p>
<p>So my old project Electric Hands Software is gone, and the most disgusting part of <code>http://elhaso.com/</code> not being available any more is that it has been claimed by automatic spambots, turning it into a casino. With black jack. And hopefully, whores:</p>
<img src="../../../i/the_definition_of_crap.png" alt="" /><p>It is clearly a sign of irrelevance when automatic software cares more about your out of business ideas than human people, I don't think that website registered more than 2000 hits during several years. So let the new <a href="http://www.elhaso.es/">Electric Hands Software website at http://www.elhaso.es/</a> shine! But this time it won't be ambitious, I've already been taught all that went wrong and why, there's no point in repeating mistakes.</p>
<p>Instead, it will live on as a hobby. And since my new hobby is <a href="http://nim-lang.org">the Nim programming language</a>, maybe I should take the crusty C source code of <a href="http://www.elhaso.es/subhunt/index.en.html">Submarine Hunt</a> and rewrite it open source in Nimrod?  Ah, if only these feelings of inebriation lasted a little bit longer…</p>
