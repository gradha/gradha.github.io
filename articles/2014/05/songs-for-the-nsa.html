		<h1>Songs for the NSA</h1><p>In some firms there is silence at work. In others the firm pays to have music played globally, maybe because the decision people who want this are incapable of thoughts and the silence of their head scares them. At one of such firms I was lobotomized to love musical hits like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsYg48vuOTo">Christina Aguilera's (aka P2P girl) Genio Atrapado (yes, in Spanish)</a>, or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujuyt65WY0M">Dame dame sung by Chayanne and Jennifer LÃ³pez</a>.  It's a shame those two didn't release a promotional video. Or is it just I can't find it? Otherwise it would have looked really hot.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to the revelations made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> everybody knows about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsa">Not Such Agency</a> and their orwellian acts. If they have music played at work, I'm sure their playlist will have hits like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs">Every breath you take, by The police</a>. Let's see some of the lyrics:</p>

<center><em>
Every breath you take<br>
And every move you make<br>
Every bond you break, every step you take<br>
I'll be watching you<p>

Every single day<br>
And every word you say<br>
Every game you play, every night you stay<br>
I'll be watching you<p>

Oh can't you see<br>
You belong to me<br>
How my poor heart aches<br>
With every step you take<p>

Every move you make<br>
And every vow you break<br>
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake<br>
I'll be watching you
</em></center><p>Don't you <span style="font-weight: bold;">love</span> such classics?</p>
