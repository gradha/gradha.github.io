Hello stranger!

This is Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz, extraordinary programmer.

I like to write `open source software <https://github.com/gradha>`_ but have to
make a living with `closed source software <http://www.elhaso.es>`_. My living
sucks, please contract me! You can `take a look at my CV
<http://gradha.sdf-eu.org/CV.en.pdf>`_ and decide to send me money. I even have
a fancy `career page <http://careers.stackoverflow.com/gradha>`_.

I used to have a `more polished personal page <http://gradha.sdf-eu.org>`_ but
it takes too much work so I stopped updating it, and now this blog seems more
polished.  Besides, who reads this anyway? All people who went there just
gloated at my beautiful pictures.

If you want to contact me about something, send your bytes to
`rants@gradha.imap.cc <mailto:rants@gradha.imap.cc>`_. `Minilock
<https://minilock.io>`_ ``JxCHWY97km5GXyvp5NACVWjVXtQJnAcAJAtqpfkbbyqTA``.

```nimrod
proc love(name: string) =
    echo "♥ " & name
    love(name)

love("gradha")
```
