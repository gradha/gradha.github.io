Why I will never use an iWatch
==============================

Because I've always hated things on my arms. I don't wear any and don't plan
to.

.. raw:: html

    <center><a href="http://www.idol-grapher.com/1235"><img
        src="../../../i/do_not_want.jpg"
        alt="AOA doesn't want either"
        style="width:100%;max-width:600px"
        hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt"></a></center>

Wow, that was short and sweet for a change!
