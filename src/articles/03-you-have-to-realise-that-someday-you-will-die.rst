You have to realise that someday you will die…
==============================================

…until you know that, you are useless. That's part of the lyrics of `This is
your life <http://www.leoslyrics.com/tyler-durden/this-is-your-life-lyrics/>`_,
part of the soundtrack to the `Fight club film
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/>`_, based on `a book by Chuck Palahniuk
<http://chuckpalahniuk.net/books/fight-club>`_. It's a sentence I like to
remember during the times when everything goes wrong: broken hardware, service
providers going out of business, breaking relationships, etc. Focusing on
whatever *is gone* is the result of getting too attached, and that can
interfere with new things in life. It simply means change, and people who are
unable to change will have a harder time than those who can adapt.

So my old project Electric Hands Software is gone, and the most disgusting part
of ``http://elhaso.com/`` not being available any more is that it has been
claimed by automatic spambots, turning it into a casino. With black jack. And
hopefully, whores:

It is clearly a sign of irrelevance when automatic software cares more about
your out of business ideas than human people, I don't think that website
registered more than 2000 hits during several years. So let the new `Electric
Hands Software website at http://www.elhaso.es/ <http://www.elhaso.es/>`_
shine! But this time it won't be ambitious, I've already been taught all that
went wrong and why, there's no point in repeating mistakes.

Instead, it will live on as a hobby. And since my new hobby is `the Nim
programming language <http://nim-lang.org>`_, maybe I should take the crusty
C source code of `Submarine Hunt <http://www.elhaso.es/subhunt/index.en.html>`_
and rewrite it opensource in nimrod?  Ah, if only these feelings of inebriation
lasted a little bit longer…

```nimrod
$ nimrod c -r life.nim
SIGSEGV: Illegal storage access. (Attempt to read from nil?)
```
