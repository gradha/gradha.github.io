Kerf timestamps done almost right: Nim
======================================

In the `previous chapter of the series
<kerf-timestamps-done-almost-right-a-new-type.html>`_ we reached the conclusion
that to implement Kerf's timestamp types we need the following features from a
programming language:

1. Value type semantics with strong typing to avoid mistakes.
2. Instancing types on the stack to avoid slow heap memory allocations and
   alleviate manual memory handling or garbage collector pressure.
3. Custom literals for easier construction of such types.
4. Operator overloading to implement all possible custom operations.
5. Generics are not necessary but help with implementation.

`Nim <http://nim-lang.org>`_ (formerly known as "Nimrod") is a statically
typed, imperative programming language that tries to give the programmer
ultimate power without compromises on runtime efficiency. This means it focuses
on compile-time mechanisms in all their various forms. However, for the task of
designing a new custom timestamp type we don't need much of this compile-time
power. Running our requirement list against Nim's feature set we get:

1. Nim has value type semantics with strong typing to avoid mistakes (yay!).
2. Allows instancing types on the stack, though we will see we don't even need
   to create our own new types because we can reuse primitive ones (super
   yay!).
3. Nim doesn't have custom literals for construction of types (booo), but it
   has such flexible syntax which makes it look as if it had them (yay!).
4. Nim allows operator overloading (yay!).
5. Very simple to write clean generics for bonus points (yay!).

With four yays and one super yay it is hard to not like this language, other
than the lack of a core timestamp type which we will quickly fix. The
implementation you see here (`available at Github
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/tree/master/nim>`_)
was the first to be done because it is the closest it can get to Kerf's core
timestamp type. The other implementations are `wannabe clones
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfV24sc-2gQ>`_.

Distinct timestamps
-------------------

.. raw:: html
    <a href="http://www.all-idol.com/1620"><img
        src="../../../i/kerf_distinct_types.jpg"
        alt="Distinct types, low maintenance, easy to use and effective, just what you need to deal with those type problems"
        style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right"
        hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt"></a>

As mentioned in the introduction chapter, we will be implementing two different
types. Internally they will have the same binary internal representation, but
they will live in different modules. The differential type will be called
``Nano`` and will live in a `time_nanos.nim file
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim>`_.
The calendar like type will be named ``Stamp`` and will live in a
`time_stamp.nim file
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim>`_.
The definition of both types is quite simple:

```nimrod
type
  Nano* = distinct int64

type
  Stamp* = distinct int64
```

In both cases what we are creating is a `distinct type
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-distinct-type>`_ based on a 64bit
integer.  Distinct types are `my favourite choice for these problems
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMZwZiU0kKs>`_ and are a way of telling the
compiler: "*Hey, could you please treat this type you know as an actually
different type and prevent me from doing stupid things to it unless I
explicitly tell you to do so?  kthxbye*".  This feature itself already provides
us with two requirements from our goals list: value semantics with strong
typing instanced on the stack for performance since we are using plain
integers. The ``*`` symbol tells the compiler to export the type making it
public for everybody to use.  After the type definition we need to tell the
compiler which existing procs for the *parent* or *base* type (huh, type
inheritance?) we want to have *borrowed* for ourselves. So for ``Nano`` `we
would use
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L5-L21>`_:

```nimrod
proc `<`*(x: Nano, y: int64): bool {.borrow.}
proc `<`*(x: int64, y: Nano): bool {.borrow.}
proc `<=`*(x: Nano, y: int64): bool {.borrow.}
proc `<=`*(x: int64, y: Nano): bool {.borrow.}
proc `mod`*(x: Nano, y: int64): int64 {.borrow.}
proc `mod`*(x: int64, y: Nano): int64 {.borrow.}
proc `mod`*(x: Nano, y: Nano): Nano {.borrow.}
proc `div`*(x: Nano, y: int64): int64 {.borrow.}
proc `div`*(x: int64, y: Nano): int64 {.borrow.}
proc `div`*(x: Nano, y: Nano): int64 {.borrow.}
proc `+`*(x, y: Nano): Nano {.borrow.}
proc `-`*(x, y: Nano): Nano {.borrow.}
proc `*`*(x, y: Nano): Nano {.borrow.}
proc `*`*(x: Nano, y: int64): Nano {.borrow.}
proc `*`*(x: int64, y: Nano): Nano = Nano(x * int64(y))
```

Backticks are used to prevent the names of our procs from being interpreted by
the compiler, they are the general identifier escaping mechanism and they are
not required for normal looking identifiers.  That last line was made explicit
without the ``{.borrow.}`` pragma to compare against the previous ones. For our
simple cases multiplication is pretty easy to implement so it may not look like
much (just a simple `type conversion
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-type-conversions>`_),
but the borrow pragma comes in handy when you have a more complex type with
busier procs.  Avoiding repetition is good and that is what this pragma does,
besides we *inherit* the upstream implementation should it change.  Following
with our custom ``Nano`` type we will `define a few constants
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L26-L33>`_
which we will be using through our code:

```nimrod
const
  u_nano* = Nano(1)
  u_second* = Nano(1_000_000_000)
  u_minute* = u_second * 60
  u_hour* = u_minute * 60
  u_day* = 24 * u_hour
  u_month* = 30 * u_day
  u_year* = u_day * 365
```

Nothing special here at first glance. All the constants are exported through
``*``. The first ones are type conversions from normal integers, one of them
showing how the underscore character can be used to group numbers visually. The
rest are the *borrowed* procs for mathematical operations which already return
our ``Nano`` type so they don't need further type conversions. Note how the
``const`` section is telling the compiler to run the code at compile time and
store the result. Numerical constants are ordinary, but we can run essentially
any Nim code and have its value pre calculated for us to avoid runtime slow
downs.

Finally we reach the `first lines of code
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L37-L43>`_
which will allow us to reach our goal of emulating Kerf timestamp types:

```nimrod
proc ns*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = Nano(x)
proc s*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_second
proc i*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_minute
proc h*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_hour
proc d*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_day
proc m*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_month
proc y*(x: int64): Nano {.inline.} = x * u_year
```

These are normal procs which either cast or multiply plain integers with our
constants to get a ``Nano`` value. We could use them like this:

```nimrod
let time1 = ns(333) + i(34)
let time2 = d(22) + y(2)
```

That's pretty boring. Previously I said that Nim doesn't have custom literals
but the syntax is flexible enough to make it look like it has them.  How? Nim
supports a flexible `method call syntax
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#procedures-method-call-syntax>`_ letting
us to invoke the method on the first integer parameter as if it had been a
class method (for primitive types!):

```nimrod
let time3 = 333.ns() + 34.i()
let time4 = 22.d + 2.y
```

The second line for ``time4`` goes through the next obvious step which is
removal of parentheses since there are no more remaining call arguments. And
that's how we get custom literals. Let's see again the equivalent Kerf syntax
for comparison (I don't have access to Kerf, so this might have typos):

```kerf
time1:333ns34i
time2:22d2y
time3:34i333ns
time4:2y22d
```
I'm guessing Kerf allows placing the time units in any order freely. It is
certainly impossible to reach Kerf's exact syntax without you know,
implementing such syntax in the compiler. Still, Nim's version is very very
similar with the following drawbacks:

1. The time unit has to be separate from the number by a dot.
2. You can't coalesce several time units into a single contiguous token.

Another possible way of implementing these, and in fact, an additional way of
doing since it can coexist with those separate pseudo literals, is creating a
string parser. Just like we defined procs for integers we can make one for
strings which at compile time parses the string and returns the ``Nano`` value
or aborts compilation due to an error. I haven't implemented it for ``Nano``
since it's a little redundant and  will look at a parsing implementation for
the ``Stamp`` literal equivalent. However, here is what it could look like:

```nimrod
# Hypothetical string literal
let time1 = Nano("333ns34i")
let time2 = n"22d2y"
let time3 = "34i333ns".n
let time4 = "2y22d".n
```

We can't get rid of the string literal delimiters, but depending on how we feel
we can use a ``Nano`` pseudo constructor, or a ``n`` shortened version which
doesn't have to use the dot separator in the prefix version since the string
quotes are already a natural delimiter. I tend to prefer not using strings
because they are like type safety pits so I will stick with the
*you-have-to-manually-add-them* version. Still, quite nice approximation to a
core native language feature without much work on our part.  The examples so
far have concentrated on the correct syntax, but you don't have to worry about
making Mars climate orbiter class type errors, here is an example of an error
the compiler will complain with if we fail to properly type the units in a
mathematical expression:

```nimrod
let error = 345 + 500.ns
# Error: type mismatch: got (int literal(345), Nano)
# but expected one of:
# time_nanos.+(x: Nano, y: Nano)
# system.+(x: int32, y: int32)
# system.+(x: float)
# system.+(x: int32)
# system.+(x: int8)
# system.+(x: int)
# system.+(x: float, y: float)
# system.+(x: set[T], y: set[T])
# system.+(x: int8, y: int8)
# system.+(x: float32, y: float32)
# system.+(x: int, y: int)
# system.+(x: int64, y: int64)
# system.+(x: int64)
# system.+(x: float32)
# system.+(x: int16)
# system.+(x: int16, y: int16)
```

The compiler looks for a proc which adds two parameters, one of type
``literal`` and another of type ``Nano``. We have not defined any for that
combination, hence we can't add untyped literals to time differentials, which
is the whole point of using distinct types. As a reminder the compiler will
list all the overloaded variants it knows of the addition proc, telling also
what module their implementation comes from. With this we can scratch two more
goals from our list: custom literals and type safe mathematical operations
through operator overloading. Moving on sequentially through the
``time_nanos.nim`` implementation we find `helpers which extract a value from a
Nano
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L45-L83>`_.
A short excerpt:

```nimrod
proc year*(x: Nano): int {.procvar.} =
  result = int(x div u_year)

proc month*(x: Nano): int {.procvar.} =
  result = int(x div u_day)
  result = (result mod 365)
  result = 1 + (result mod 12)

proc week*(x: Nano): int {.procvar.} =
  result = int(x div u_day)
  result = (result mod 365)
  result = 1 + (result div 7)
```

That section defines the date component getters for the type, which can be used
as proc calls in prefix or postfix notation to extract the year, month, week,
etc of a ``Nano`` value. As you can see from the implementation I'm totally
ignoring any calendar realities: all years are 365 days, the month and weeks
are extracted through a simple modulo operation ignoring any real calendarâ€¦ as
warned before this is not a full, complete and perfect implementation of the
functionality. These getters maybe don't have much sense for the ``Nano`` type
but I felt like implementing them here, ``Stamp`` will just reuse them.  But
for a *real* implementation it could make sense that the ``Nano`` week getter
and the ``Stamp`` week getter had different results. The interval week getter
could calculate the amount of weeks the interval spans, returning a fractional
value. The calendar week getter would instead provide you the week number index
of the year the specific date falls at.

Following the date component getters there's the `stringify proc for the Nano
type
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L86-L125>`_:

```nimrod
proc `$`*(x: Nano): string =
  if x < 1:
    return "0s"

  var
    nano = x mod 1_000_000_000
    seconds = (x div 1_000_000_000) mod 60
    minutes = x div 60_000_000_000

  result = (if 0 == nano: "" else: $nano & "ns")
  result = (if 0 == seconds: result else: $seconds & "s" & result)
  if minutes < 1:
    return

  var hours = minutes div 60
  minutes = minutes mod 60

  result = (if 0 == minutes: result else: $minutes & "m" & result)
  if hours < 1:
    return

  var days = hours div 24
  hours = hours mod 24

  result = (if 0 == hours: result else: $hours & "h" & result)
  if days < 1:
    return

  let years = days div 365
  days = days mod 365

  result = (if 0 == days: result else: $days & "d" & result)
  if years < 1:
    return

  result = $years & "y" & result
```

In Nim the `$ operator <http://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#$>`_ is used
generically to convert anything to a string.  The `system.echo()
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#echo>`_ proc used to output values uses
an additional feature, `Nim variadic parameters allow specifying an automatic
type conversion proc <http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-varargs>`_.
What this means is that we don't have to type ``$`` in many situations because
the compiler can figure that out and spare us.

The implementation of this ``$`` proc won't win any performance contests, it is
just the first version I came up which looked more or less understandable. The
``Nano`` value is being split in units and each is converted to a string with
the appropriate suffix. Some logic is added to avoid outputting *empty* units,
which makes the string representation more compact and similar to what you
would write as input to the compiler. I made the output match Kerf's examples,
but maybe it would have been better to match Nim input exactly and separate the
time units in the final string with addition sings, so you could copy and paste
the output from ``echo()`` somewhere else and have it work. Again, freedom we
have since the type is not core to the language and we can decide what it does
(or if this came from a library, customize/override the behaviour).

After the ``$`` proc implementation there come `two helpers for string concatenation <https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L127-L129>`_:

```nimrod
proc `&`*(x: Nano, y: string): string = $x & y
proc `&`*(x: string, y: Nano): string = x & $y
```

On top of the ``$`` proc, Nim uses the `& operator
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#&>`_ to concatenate strings. Why not
overload the addition operator like for example in Java? There are different
preferences to this but they also depend on context. In Java there is no
operator overloading so it is OK if the language defines this especially for
String objects. However in a language like Nim you are allowed and sometimes
encouraged to create your own operators. Since addition is such a generic
operator it is best to keep it from having the meaning of concatenating stuff,
otherwise if you wrote **by mistake** the addition between a string and a
``Nano`` you could end up with the compiler stringifying the ``Nano`` value and
concatenating it to the previous variable. This is a bad idea, hence a ``&``
operator is preferred in languages which allow overloading, to avoid confusion
and/or extra parentheses around your expressions to coerce them to the expected
type. This little design decision will have implications in the Swift
implementation.

After these helpers we have `another custom operator helper <https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L132-L139>`_. It's usage is not obvious at the moment so we will come back to it by the end of the article. The implementation `ends up with a basic self unit testing code <https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L142-L167>`_ I wrote to verify I'm not doing anything too stupid. From this code we can see how near or far we have come to Kerf's version:

```nimrod
const
  composed_difference = 1.h + 23.i + 45.s
  composed_string = $composed_difference


proc test_seconds*() =
  echo "Testing second operations:\n"
  echo Nano(500), " = ", 500.ns
  echo u_second, " = ", 1.s
  echo u_minute + u_second + Nano(500), " = ", 1.i + 1.s + 500.ns
  echo u_hour, " = ", 1.h
  echo 1.h + 23.i + 45.s, " = ", composed_difference, " = ", composed_string
  echo u_day, " = ", 1.d
  echo u_year, " = ", 1.y
  echo u_year - 1.d

  let a = composed_difference + 3.y + 6.m + 4.d + 12_987.ns
  echo "total ", a
  echo "\tyear ", a.year
  echo "\tmonth ", a.month
  echo "\tday ", a.day
  echo "\thour ", a.hour
  echo "\tminute ", a.minute
  echo "\tsecond ", a.second
```

The Kerf language compiles to C, and Nim does the same, both are equally cross
platform. Since Nim allows running mostly any Nim code at compile time, the
``const`` block will run the ``Nano`` conversions at compilation time and will
embed the final value in the C output source. By now you shouldn't have
troubles understanding all these lines and figuring their expected output, but
here it is in any case:

```none
Testing second operations:

500ns = 500ns
1s = 1s
1m1s500ns = 1m1s500ns
1m1s500ns = 1m1s500ns
1h = 1h
1h23m45s = 1h23m45s = 1h23m45s
1d = 1d
1y = 1y
364d
total 3y184d1h23m45s12987ns
	year 3
	month 5
	day 5
	hour 1
	minute 23
	second 45
```

I'm not an integer, not yet a Date
----------------------------------

The implementation of the `time_stamp.nim file
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim>`_
implementing the parallel ``Stamp`` type is very similar to ``Nano``, I'll
cover only any new interesting details. The first one is that we can `borrow basic mathematical operators to mix our types <https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L6-L10>`_:

```nimrod
proc `+`*(x: Stamp, y: Nano): Stamp {.borrow.}
proc `+`*(x: Nano, y: Stamp): Stamp {.borrow.}
proc `-`*(x: Stamp, y: Nano): Stamp {.borrow.}
proc `-`*(x: Nano, y: Stamp): Stamp {.borrow.}
```

Of course the important thing is that we are **not** defining these operations
for two ``Stamp`` types, we respect the laws of space-time continuum in this
blog.  Just below we define `a few internal non exported constants
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L12-L22>`_
for string parsing, `wrappers for Stamp calendar component getters
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L25-L34>`_
as mentioned above, and finally the *pseudo* `custom literal for construction
of Stamp types from strings
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L37-L103>`_:

```nimrod
proc date*(x: string): Stamp =
  var token: string
  do_assert 4 == x.parse_while(token, Digits, year_start)
  var
    yyyy: int
    mm: int
    dd: int
  do_assert 4 == token.parse_int(yyyy)
  do_assert yyyy >= epoch_offset

  do_assert 2 == x.parse_while(token, Digits, month_start)
  do_assert 2 == token.parse_int(mm)
  do_assert mm > 0 and mm < 13

  do_assert 2 == x.parse_while(token, Digits, days_start)
  do_assert 2 == token.parse_int(dd)
  do_assert dd > 0 and dd < 32

  # Finally, convert the individual values to a (fake) calendar.
  result = Stamp((yyyy - epoch_offset) * u_year +
    (mm - 1) * days_in_a_month * u_day + (dd - 1) * u_day)

  if x.len < minutes_start - 1:
    return

  # Ugh, we got some timesâ€¦ ok, try to parse them.
  â€¦more boring codeâ€¦

proc d*(x: string): Stamp {.inline.} = x.date
```

The whole proc was shortened a bit for the blog because it is not very
interesting. As you can see it simply goes through the string attempting to
parse digits. Since this is a simple naive implementation it doesn't do much
other than assert very basic conditions, and error reporting to the user in
case of syntax failure is abysmal. But at least it works for our example. The
last additional ``d()`` proc definition creates a convenience alias to shorten
optional instantiation of ``Stamp`` types so we can write lines like:

```nimrod
let a = "2012.01.01".date + 1.d
let b = d"2012.01.01"
let c = "2012.01.01".d
```

The first one uses the known postfix parentheses less version to construct a date from a string (plus adding a single day to it). The second uses the optional ``d()`` alias in a prefix version and the third in postfix. Why does this not get confused with the ``1.d`` bit? Because one function accepts integer literals and the other one accepts strings, we've been using proc overloading for a while now so this shouldn't be a surprise. Potential addition errors are detected just like in the previous ``Nano`` example:

```nimrod
let error = d"2012.01.01" + "2012.01.01".d
# Error: type mismatch: got (Stamp, Stamp)
# but expected one of: 
# system.+(x: int32, y: int32)
# system.+(x: float)
# system.+(x: int32)
# system.+(x: int8)
# system.+(x: int)
# system.+(x: float, y: float)
# system.+(x: set[T], y: set[T])
# system.+(x: int8, y: int8)
# system.+(x: float32, y: float32)
# system.+(x: int, y: int)
# system.+(x: int64, y: int64)
# system.+(x: int64)
# system.+(x: float32)
# system.+(x: int16)
# system.+(x: int16, y: int16)
# time_nanos.+(x: Nano, y: Nano)
# time_stamp.+(x: Nano, y: Stamp)
# time_stamp.+(x: Stamp, y: Nano)
# time_stamp.+(x: Stamp, y: seq[Nano])
```

Other than the extra addition proc overloads available to the compiler the
reported error should be familiar. After having seen the stringify proc for the
``Nano`` type I won't copy the `Stamp version
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L107-L155>`_
because it doesn't add anything worthy to the discussion. Then we get two more
`helper procs
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L158-L173>`_
which will remain as hidden ninjas prepared to strike at a later time, and the
`typical self unit testing code
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L176-L202>`_:

```nimrod
echo "Testing stamps\n"
var a = date"2012-01-01"
echo "let's start at ", a
echo "plus one day is ", a + 1.d

As you can see this is just normal exercising of the code to verify visually
that nothing terrible is going on. With this module in place we can finally
emulate the Kerf examples set as our goal in the first chapter.

The Kerf comparison test
------------------------

Let's create a new file named `units.nim
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim>`_
from which we will test everything. Running the compiler with ``nim c -r
units.nim`` is enough to get the output of the individual self unit testing
already shown plus the following lines:

```none

Extra points b[bonusWeek]: @[^1^, ^5^, ^9^, ^14^, ^18^, ^23^, ^27^, ^32^, ^36^, ^40^]

Did all examples.
```

The `first three examples
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L9-L14>`_
have already been explained. The fourth example has been split in three
versions which were the ones I wrote to approximate the final one. `The first
is the verbose one
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L16-L21>`_:

```nimrod
let
  r = to_seq(0 .. <10)
  offsets = r.map_it(Nano, (1.m + 1.d + 1.h + 15.i + 17.s) * it)
  values = offsets.map_it(Stamp, d"2012.01.01" + it)

echo "Example 4: ", values
```

This is pretty verbose compared to the Kerf version, but it's easier to start
from here to understand what is going on. The first assignment creates a
sequence variable from a range using `sequtils.toSeq()
<http://nim-lang.org/docs/sequtils.html#toSeq>`_. The second line uses
`sequtils.mapIt() <http://nim-lang.org/docs/sequtils.html#mapIt>`_ to apply or
map some code to each of its elements and return a new sequence. Here we have
the template injected ``it`` variable representing each entry in the sequence,
which is multiplied against a ``Nano`` type (side note: this is old Nim style,
as mentioned in the documentation newer Nim 0.13 versions don't require
specifying the type of the returned items as first parameter of ``mapIt()``
because the type is inferred properly by the compiler). The `second version is
simply an attempt to put it all in a single big expression
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L23-L25>`_:

```nimrod
echo "â€¦again but compressedâ€¦ ", to_seq(0 .. <10)
    .map_it(Nano, (1.m + 1.d + 1.h + 15.i + 17.s) * it)
    .map_it(Stamp, "2012.01.01".date + it)
```

Quite boring stuff, this uses the typical object oriented dot notation
continuations where a long line expression is broken into multiple lines
because the parser allows you to do so placing the dot as the first non white
space character on the next line. The problem here is that we can't get rid of
the two ``mapIt()`` calls which are verbose. Or can we? Yes, we can! With help
from additional operator overloading we can reach `the final form
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L27-L28>`_:

```nimrod
echo "â€¦using helper procsâ€¦ ",
  d"2012.01.01" + (1.m + 1.d + 1.h + 15.i + 17.s) * (0 .. <10)
```

What we have here is overloading of the `multiplication proc with a slice of
integers
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L132-L139>`_:

```nimrod
proc `*`*(x: Nano, y: Slice[int]): seq[Nano] =
  let total_len = y.b - y.a + 1
  result.new_seq(total_len)
  var pos = 0
  while pos < total_len:
    result[pos] = x * (pos + y.a)
    pos.inc
```

The helper takes a ``Nano`` and *multiplies* it against the slice, returning a
new sequence. This sequence is then mapped against an overload of the `addition
operator between Stamps and sequence of Nanos
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L158-L164>`_:

```nimrod
proc `+`*(x: Stamp, y: seq[Nano]): seq[Stamp] =
  result.new_seq(y.len)
  var pos = 0
  while pos < y.len:
    result[pos] = x + y[pos]
    pos.inc
```

In a similar way to the multiplication operator, another list is constructed
applying the addition of each element to the input ``Stamp`` value, returning
the final result. Here is the original Kerf version we wanted to compete with:

```none
KeRF> b: 2012.01.01 + (1m1d + 1h15i17s) times mapright  range(10)
Nim>  let b = d"2012.01.01" + (1.m + 1.d + 1.h + 15.i + 17.s) * (0 .. <10)
```

Some verbosity due to the lack of real custom syntax is recovered through the
overloading of the operators to avoid having to write ``times mapright
range(10)``, but all in all the result is quite the same in readability. If you
don't like operators you could use names as in Kerf, remember that there is
nothing special about writing an operator in Nim, it's just a proc with two
parameters. The `last bit of the example may throw you off
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L30-L31>`_:

```nimrod
echo "Example 5 b[week]: ", values[week]
# Example 5 b[week]: @[1, 5, 9, 14, 18, 23, 27, 32, 36, 40]
echo "Example 5 b[second]: ", values[second]
# Example 5 b[second]: @[0, 17, 34, 51, 8, 25, 42, 59, 16, 33]
```

If we compare the numbers to the Kerf version it doesn't match:

```none
b['week']
  [1, 6, 10, 15, 19, 24, 28, 33, 37, 42]
b['second']
  [0, 17, 34, 51, 8, 25, 42, 59, 16, 33]
```

Remember when I quickly and naively implemented the `week() date component
getter
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_nanos.nim#L54-L57>`_?
I explicitly **did not** implement real calendars because that is boring. So if
you look at the calendar you will see that the differences between Keft and my
Nim implementation is that the first week of 2012 starts on the 2nd day of
January and not on the 8th day like the simple implementation presumes. A real
implementation would do this right and the Nim output would then equal Kerfs.


Bonus generic subscript operator
--------------------------------

The last lines of the Nim implementation use a `bonusWeek() proc defined
earlier
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L4>`_:

```nimrod
echo "Extra points b[bonusWeek]: ", values[bonusWeek]
# Extra points b[bonusWeek]: @[^1^, ^5^, ^9^, ^14^, ^18^, ^23^, ^27^, ^32^, ^36^, ^40^]
```

Let's explain first that what we are doing here is `overloading the subscript
operator for sequences
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L167-L173>`_:

```nimrod
proc `[]`*[S,T](x: seq[S], filter: proc (x: S): T): seq[T] =
  result.new_seq(x.len)
  var pos = 0
  while pos < x.len:
    result[pos] = filter(x[pos])
    pos.inc
```

Hey! Where did ``Stamp`` and ``Nano`` go?  That's right, the ``S`` and ``T``
are generic types, that proc definition applies to anything that will match the
signature. So what it is doing is that for sequences of type ``S``, the
parameter will be applied to each entry and a new sequence returned. We have
just reimplemented the ``mapIt()`` template. The ``filter`` parameter requires
that the proc accepts an ``S`` type as input and generates a ``T`` type. And
you know what does that? Yes, the date component getters we implemented before.
All those returned integers, `remember
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/time_stamp.nim#L25-L34>`_?
The `bonusWeek() proc returns strings instead
<https://github.com/gradha/kerf_timestamps_done_almost_right/blob/master/nim/units.nim#L4>`_
and that's fine because supporting generics the compiler will generate the
procs with the appropriate types time during compilation.

This is what I meant in the previous chapter about a potential Kerf design
mistake or limitation: Kerf seems to overload the subscript operator for
sequences but uses an input string as parameter. Since Kerf claims to be
interpreted maybe this doesn't pose a problem, the interpreter can look in the
environment and match against any function with the specified name. But it
feels odd, as if their implementation used a big ass string switch, which would
users prevent from customizing the operations to filter the sequence.  Who
knows, it's not really that important in the grand scheme of things.

Conclusion
----------

What is important is that with a generic programming language we have matched
the feature set of Kerf's native timestamp type, plus we can implement it in
different ways not limiting ourselves to a niche. Or rather the genericness of
the language supports any design requirements by the programmers using it,
allowing them to implement new types as needed in search of the optimal
performance.

Does then our timestamp type have **anything** to do with storing dates or
ticks in a database? Nope. The type uses an integer storing nanoseconds, but by
the time we write to the database in our serialization layer we could be
storing it `encoded in emoji
<http://www.emojicode.org/docs/guides/compile-and-run.html>`_ just for fun and
to annoy other people. It would be a really poor storage decision, and Scott
would loudly complain about Unicode conversion performance bottlenecks, but it
wouldn't hurt the type at all in the language. Next `we will do this in C++
<kerf-timestamps-done-almost-right-c-plus--plus-.html>`_ (I mean the Kerf
timestamp, not the weird emoji shit).
