Summary: About me

Hello stranger!

This is Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz, extraordinaire programmer.
![Me](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11bbe1aacddb0e5c5bb5bf45c5570be0?s=420)

I like to write [open source software](https://github.com/gradha) but have to
make a living with [closed source software](http://elhaso.es). My living
sucks though, please pay me!

I used to have a [more polished page](http://gradha.sdf-eu.org) but it takes
too much work so I stopped updating it. Besides, who reads this anyway? All
people who went there gloated at my beautiful pictures.

		echo " ðŸ’• " & name
		love(name)

	love("gradha")
