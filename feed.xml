&lt;h1&gt;Machine learning is killing Dropbox search&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href="https://toodur2.tistory.com/1938"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../i/dropbox_searching.jpg" alt="A webapp in Nim? What is he smoking? Is that possible at all?" style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right" hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Waking up with your left foot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the &lt;a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/"&gt;Dropbox Tech Blog&lt;/a&gt; published one article titled &lt;a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/05/content-suggestions-machine-learning/"&gt;Using machine learning to predict what file you need next&lt;/a&gt; which ended ticking me off. The reason is simple, Dropbox search feature stopped working for me about two years ago. Unfortunately I'm used to dozens of products having bugs that make them inconvenient, and you simply learn to live with crap because fixing it is more expensive than ignoring it. As a programmer you learn that software is far from being the product of a single person, and groups of different people have different views on what quality is, means, or how it is achieved. We are all slaves to the financial aspect of business anyway, and we know the business side doesn't really care about bugs unless they torpedo their income, so priorities tend to be somewhere else (shiny new features! Shinyyyyyyy!). So seeing the Dropbox blog gloat about how awesome machine learning is finally prompted me to make public how crap their search actually is, and has been for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;From Python windows console to Nim Karax webapp&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A challenger appears&lt;/h2&gt;

Is that possible at all?" style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right" hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between people who really love programming and those who treat technology like inscrutable magic there are those like Kpopalypse who are capable of building software without being dedicated programmers. If you go to &lt;a href="https://kpopalypse.com/"&gt;Kpopalypse's website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kpopalypse.com/2014/01/20/kpopalypse-faq/"&gt;click on Sully&lt;/a&gt; you will find out many facts about his persona, but you will miss that he has released &lt;a href="https://kpopalypse.com/2018/10/19/stan-loona-or-else/"&gt;sp00ky interactive Halloween fanfiction&lt;/a&gt; or adventure games like &lt;a href="https://kpopalypse.com/2019/01/24/escape-from-the-idol-dungeon-an-adventure-game-by-kpopalypse/"&gt;Escape from the Idol Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, showing higher than average levels of determination to understand and dominate technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently Kpopalypse released a &lt;a href="https://kpopalypse.com/2019/02/24/the-kpopalypse-fan-comment-generator/"&gt;fan comment generator&lt;/a&gt;, which allows anybody with a Windows computer to mechanize the act of answering posts in crazy kpop forums.

&lt;h1&gt;Package managers, the lazy alternative to git submodules&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.idol-grapher.com/2099"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../i/lazy_developers.jpg" alt="I'm not lazy, I'm just saving my energy" style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right" hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Package managers have always looked strange to me. Why would you &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; to use one?  It is actually not weird to have that point of view, especially if your background comes from programming languages like C or C++, which don't have any well known package manager (&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/36023212/172690"&gt;even though people keep trying to build some&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3d1vjq/is_there_a_c_package_manager_if_not_how_do_you/"&gt;developers resort to using the system libraries/packages or git submodules to manage their software builds&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, people mostly coming from interpreted languages are so used to the idea that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; using a package manager seems like crazy advice. Today, software development uses some form of source content management, and it seems like &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;won the war&lt;/span&gt;, especially since it is used by &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, possibly the most popular free repository choice for open source and free software. As such, many de...&lt;/p&gt;1484 bytes out of 31726.</content>

It is funny to me that I didn't even know such a thing existed until 2010, when one of my previous coworkers released &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101027221033/http://www.latitudie.com/"&gt;Latitudie&lt;/a&gt;, which was an iOS app using Google's Latitude service (I even did buy it and use it for my nefarious purposes!).

      <content type="html">
&lt;h1&gt;Chromecast without internet is the Shitcast&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer is one of those times of the year technical savvy people need to step away from their usual hardware devices or face being labelled geeks, nerds, autists, aspergers, freaks, or whatever the hip word is among the non technical people. Writing software on the computer or teaching yourself new stuff at home is bad. On the other hand, risking skin cancer and cirrhosis at the beach while forwarding stale memes with privative messaging apps is cool.&lt;/p&gt;

Again." style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right" hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting my parents far away from civilization for a week I wanted to test this thingy called &lt;a href="http://chromecast.com/"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, sold by &lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in supermarkets. It's a cheap computer/Android streaming receiver you connect to a screen. My parents like watching low quality videos of old memes sent through &lt;a href="http://www.whatsapp.com"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, but prefer to do so on a big screen rather than their small phones, so I thought of bringing it along some downloaded stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The experiment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I tested the Chromecast first at home. The setup went really smooth, and even when I tried to switch WiFi networks or i...&lt;/p&gt;1483 bytes out of 12506.</content>

&lt;h1&gt;Apple's Core Data greatest feature: brainwashing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.idol-grapher.com/1695"&gt;&lt;img src="../../../i/core_data_pretty.jpg" alt="Core Data, pretty on the outside, but painful once you use it" style="width:100%;max-width:600px" align="right" hspace="8pt" vspace="8pt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that another project is ending for me, it's always a good idea to review the good and bad things, a postmortem. This time, thanks to Sir Arthur's Legacy from Crazy Hipster Land (you know who you are!) I got to deal with Apple's Core Data &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; another time, for a project which didn't really need it. Thanks to Apple being idiots, it's never possible to hard link any kind of their documentation with confidence because it seems to move every year with each new SDK update, so I have now the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html"&gt;following documentation link&lt;/a&gt; in case you don't know what Core Data is, but who knows for how long it will last. Your best chance is to Google &amp;quot;Apple's Core Data&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just like any tool, framework, library, etc, you can use stuff just for the sake of it even if you don't need it. And sometimes the use can be justified through external reasons, like using a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;lesser&lt;/span&gt; programming language because it is easier to find programmers for your team. But regardless of justification, C...&lt;/p&gt;1484 bytes out of 18712.</content>
