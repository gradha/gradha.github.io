        &lt;h1&gt;Testing installation instructions&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit testing seems like the most recent and popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=e-penis&quot;&gt;e-penis&lt;/a&gt; game in the industry: not only can you brag about useless stuff in big numbers (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;look, we have more than thousand unit tests for stuff nobody uses!&lt;/span&gt;), but you can push this data to upper management and they will pat you on your back for it. Not because they find that unit testing is useful for software, promotes sane development approaches, documents working code and corner cases/bugs, or in general requires some interest in output from code monkeys.  No, they like unit testing because it can be represented as a number associated with specific developers, and the human resources department can compare these numbers over time to increase salaries. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3769716/how-bad-is-sloc-source-lines-of-code-as-a-metric&quot;&gt;It's lines of code all over again, and everybody loves it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for very specific kinds of software, unit testing is likely not very useful to end users. In fact, when you test something &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;which matters&lt;/span&gt; to end users, it stops being called unit testing, and it is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing&quot;&gt;integration testing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation_(software)&quot;&gt;validation testing&lt;/a&gt;. This is serious crap. Like keeping virtual machines which simulate the &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;first installation&lt;/span&gt; by the user on an otherwise clean state OS (so you know if that 3rd party library you recently added requires an additional DLL install). Or if your software doesn't run in a virtual machine, keeping the hardware machines (with spares) to keep testing newer versions. These kinds of testing tend to take days compared to minutes in the software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately they are a pain in the ass to set up, so even important projects don't care about them and depend on beta test… er, users, to tell them something has gone wrong. One critical point of many open source projects which goes untested is: installation instructions. You know, the little sequence of commands which tells you what to do to actually get the source code, build it, and maybe install it. Either in binary or source form, installation instructions are the first step for your users and other potential developers to know about you. Bad installation instructions are the equivalent of a web page which never loads: users will look elsewhere. Yet they are not that difficult to test. In fact, everybody should be testing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing dropbox_filename_sanitizer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this article I'll be using my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer&quot;&gt;dropbox_filename_sanitizer project&lt;/a&gt; because pointing errors in other people's software is too easy and doesn't enrich me. This project also offers a nice range of things to test: there is a stable source code installation, a development source code installation, and a pre built binary installation. In addition the program is implemented with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod programming language&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org/news.html#Z2014-04-21-version-0-9-4-released&quot;&gt;recently released version 0.9.4&lt;/a&gt;. A programming language in development may well render the source code useless between versions, so we will have to expand the source code tests to cover one using the stable compiler release and another using the unstable one. If my math is not wrong, that's more than a single test, enough to impress your mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platforms to test are macosx and linux. You can test Windows too, you can do nice things with &lt;a href=&quot;https://oracleexamples.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/virtualbox-script-to-control-virtual-machines/&quot;&gt;VirtualBox alone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-windows.html&quot;&gt;with additional tools like Vagrant&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't own any Windows licenses and have little interest in getting one. Since both target platforms are unix-like, we will be able to reuse the scripting for both using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; or whatever shell used by the systems used to run the test cases (if you don't control the environment, like on virtual host). We won't go the full virtual machine route because it is time expensive, and also because we can easily emulate nearly clean state environments through additional users.&lt;/p&gt;

    alt=&quot;The only sane approach to software testing&quot;
    style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
    hspace=&quot;8pt&quot; vspace=&quot;8pt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy then is to create a separate user for testing in your own machine. This user won't have any of the installed dependencies required for installation, and we will install everything in specific directories which can later be erased to prevent them from polluting future tests. If the software you are using requires installation in global paths, you need a virtual machine then anyway. Certainly you don't &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/span&gt; software to have a good uninstallation mechanism, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate user account on the machine is easier to nuke from orbit should anything go wrong, but it also helps to keep yourself honest about the testing environment. If you run the tests as your development user many little environment changes can creep in and alter the tests. First we will write some code which will gather necessary runtime variables from the development environment or from json files producing a bash script. Then we copy the bash script to the user through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell&quot;&gt;secure shell&lt;/a&gt; and run it remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secure shell abstraction forces us to make a script which works remotely, can be run at any time, and we can run one instance in our development machine (macosx) and another one on a virtual box or hosted server (linux). Secure shells are also easier to set up with public/private keys to avoid interactive prompts during testing. Of course you can set up passwords into the test scripts, but you have to be careful about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stewilliams.com/silly-gits-upload-private-crypto-keys-to-public-github-projects/&quot;&gt;private secrets not leaking to public repositories&lt;/a&gt;. Making sure the user ssh setup is &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; part of your software repository can sometimes be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing the stable babel installation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install the stable version of dropbox_filename_sanitizer the user only has to type the following commands:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
$ babel update
$ babel install argument_parser
$ babel install dropbox_filename_sanitizer&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: presumably you don't have to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/argument_parser&quot;&gt;argument_parser&lt;/a&gt; manually since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nimrod-code/babel&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/a&gt; will take care of dependencies. Unfortunately &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nimrod-code/babel/issues/37&quot;&gt;a bug prevents correct installation&lt;/a&gt; due to a mistake in handling version numbers. Yes, the problem was found while &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/issues/12&quot;&gt;setting up the project for testing&lt;/a&gt; in advance for this blog post. Bug inception!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the project already features a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/blob/master/nakefile.nim&quot;&gt;nakefile&lt;/a&gt; which drives other tasks (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fowlmouth/nake&quot;&gt;nake project&lt;/a&gt;) I decided to add a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/blob/329d5e7a52e5b4a705f89a68a751ce698e941501/nakefile.nim#L372&quot;&gt;shell_test&lt;/a&gt; command. This command accepts &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/tree/329d5e7a52e5b4a705f89a68a751ce698e941501/shell_tests&quot;&gt;json files&lt;/a&gt; which contain some parameters of what is to be tested. Let's see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/blob/329d5e7a52e5b4a705f89a68a751ce698e941501/shell_tests/macosx_igor_nimrod_devel_chunk1.json&quot;&gt;one of those json files first&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;: These are the typical host and user parameters for the secure shell. Use &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; and a different user on your own machine to simulate a clean install.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nimrod_branch&lt;/code&gt;: Specifies which branch to check out for the Nimrod compiler. You can specify tags as well for previous releases. In this case, we use the development branch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nimrod_version_str&lt;/code&gt;: The string we will use with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/a&gt; in the script to verify that the compiler we invoke is the proper one. Since this is the development version, we don't care about the version, but stable version checking will feature a specific number (like 0.9.4).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nimrod_csources_branch&lt;/code&gt;: Similar to &lt;code&gt;nimrod_branch&lt;/code&gt;, this is the branch used by the sub repository csources required by the compiler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chunk_file&lt;/code&gt;: Name of the documentation file we will extract installation steps performed by the user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chunk_number&lt;/code&gt;: Index of the instructions &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; that we are testing. The readme features several possible instructions, having different json files for each block.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin_version&lt;/code&gt;: Similar to &lt;code&gt;nimrod_version_str&lt;/code&gt;, this parameter specifies if we are testing against the development version of dropbox_filename_sanitizer (which will get the number directly imported from the module) or the last stable version (which will be obtained from git tags).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nakefile code for the task is a little bit split and tough to follow sequentially, so I've put at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae&lt;/a&gt; an example of generated shell script. This is the shell script that is copied to the remote user and run as is. The only dependency required is a working compiler. The script first sets up some variables to reuse, removes previous temporary files which could have been left from failure runs, and starts to install both the Nimrod compiler and babel. Quite boring, but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the very end of the script, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae#file-shell_test_1398956253-sh-L58&quot;&gt;on line 58&lt;/a&gt; you will recognise the three commands mentioned above to update babel, install argument_parser, then install the program. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae#file-shell_test_1398956253-sh-L54&quot;&gt;Previously line 54&lt;/a&gt; did export the private babel binary directory (&lt;code&gt;.babel/bin&lt;/code&gt;) to test a normal user invoking the binary without typing the full path to it. This can be seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae#file-shell_test_1398956253-sh-L62&quot;&gt;last test line 62&lt;/a&gt; which verifies the installed version of the command running the command's &lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; switch piped to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/a&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; doesn't find a match it will return an error, which will abort the whole script, courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gradha/aff3c6d53657a27e4cae#file-shell_test_1398956253-sh-L4&quot;&gt;line 4 forcing immediate exit&lt;/a&gt; if any of the following commands returns a non zero error status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing the development babel installation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install the development version of dropbox_filename_sanitizer the user has to type a little bit more:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
$ babel update
$ babel install argument_parser
$ git clone https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer.git
$ cd dropbox_filename_sanitizer
$ babel install&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that instead of asking babel to fetch the package we clone the git repository and install it manually by omitting the parameter (and having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/blob/master/dropbox_filename_sanitizer.babel&quot;&gt;babel spec file available&lt;/a&gt; in the working directory). The only difference between the stable and development versions of the test script will be the lines run to install the software. These lines are obtained through the previously mentioned &lt;code&gt;chunk_number&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the json file.  The crude &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/blob/329d5e7a52e5b4a705f89a68a751ce698e941501/nakefile.nim#L252&quot;&gt;gen_chunk_script&lt;/a&gt; proc in the nakefile will parse the readme and extract all the lines for whatever block was specified. One could go hi-tech and use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org/rst_module.html&quot;&gt;rst nimrod module&lt;/a&gt; to parse the readme, but simple line stripping serves well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing the pre built binaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't bothered yet to do this for a very simple reason: you only need to test this once. The compiled binaries work without dependencies, so by the time you create them, you test them yourself once and… that's it! It's the source installation which depends on many more steps and packages which can go wrong. Certainly there is room to test for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/dropbox_filename_sanitizer/issues/11&quot;&gt;failures in the packaging itself&lt;/a&gt;, but the packaging itself is automated. Maybe if I get very bored I'll do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img

    style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:750px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
    hspace=&quot;8pt&quot; vspace=&quot;8pt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes some time to set these kind of tests, but they are critical: if potential users of your software find that they can't even install it, they won't bother to contact you to fix it, you require a lot of interest for that to happen. So you better know first that something is broken. The huge amount of github projects which don't even compile without tweaking is sad (or maybe I'm just unlucky?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus you know when things go wrong without others having to tell you. Since these integration tests also test external software software, you are sort of contributing to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod community&lt;/a&gt; by testing the compiler (both the last stable and last development versions) and the approved package manager used by many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've wondered if these tests should go the route of continuous integration. That seems to be a lot of work but possible through &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/&quot;&gt;GitHub webhooks&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand maybe webhooks don't work for watching external repositories you don't have control over. Since installation instructions are not going to change from day to day, it would be also possible to write a polling script which every night checks the current nimrod compiler version, and if changed, runs the tests.  Changing from continuous integration to nightly builds is not that bad either and still provides a reasonably fast response to external changes if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you develop a Nimrod based pseudo continuous software tester, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">
        &lt;h1&gt;Could Dropbox switch to Nimrod?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;More interesting changes have been announced in the language arena &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradha.github.io/articles/2014/04/../03/the-sweet-trap-of-dynamic-languages-and-development-time.html&quot;&gt;just a few days after I wrote my opinion on Facebook announcing the Hack programming language&lt;/a&gt;. So rather than a longish useless rant, this is more like an appendix to that article. The interesting things announced were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/04/02/announcing-net-native-preview.aspx&quot;&gt;Microsoft announces .NET Native&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially compiles C# with their C++ backend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.dropbox.com/2014/04/introducing-pyston-an-upcoming-jit-based-python-implementation/&quot;&gt;Dropbox announces Pyston, a JIT-based Python implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these announces highlight that anything dynamic has trouble in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;real world&lt;/span&gt; out there. Scaling servers is cool, but not having to throw millions at hardware and still meet your goals is even better. The perspective for both companies is different, though. Microsoft is likely targeting &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;embedded&lt;/span&gt; developers, aka, writing C# code for Windows Phone or Xbox and keep 60 frames per second while consuming the minimum possible amount of resources. On the other hand, the Dropbox announcement is particularly interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;After some abandoned experiments with static compilation, we looked around and saw how successfully JIT techniques are being applied in the JavaScript space[...]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really intriguing. Static compilation tends to solve the performance problems, but might introduce other development downsides. Other commenters of the blog post itself mention several alternatives to statically compiling Python, as in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;did you try this? why isn't it good?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;.  Many of them have performance limits imposed by the language: you either can't optimize a dynamic language  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;all the way&lt;/span&gt; compared to other statically compiled languages, or you have to restrict yourself to a subset of Python or modify it, which depending on how you do you may need to throw away your existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of going the way of Facebook and adding optional static typing they are instead keeping the dynamic nature of the language and instead looking at providing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;type speculation&lt;/span&gt;.  Based on the blog post description of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;type speculation&lt;/span&gt;, you can likely understand more by watching the Strange Loop talk &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ruby-performance&quot;&gt;Why Ruby Isn't Slow&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexgaynor.net&quot;&gt;Alex Gaynor&lt;/a&gt;. Really nice talk, it mentions the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/rpython/&quot;&gt;horrible RPython implementation&lt;/a&gt; (Alex's words, not mine) which allows defining these &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;probabilistic&lt;/span&gt; hints for the optimizer, like: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;well, this property is now a string, and it is 99% likely going to be a string all the time, so maybe you should actually ignore type checks and indirections and stuff and directly access it like a string&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;. If you are interested in dynamic languages evolution and optimization, you can also watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/dynamic-performance&quot;&gt;Fast and Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointersgonewild.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I would propose using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod programming language&lt;/a&gt; to any Python programmer looking for a more performant, saner language. But Dropbox didn't start yesterday to write code, and surely they have tons of code. They must have considered that keeping with Python and implementing a faster interpreter is more cost effective than switching to a different language. Don't think just in terms of rewriting code but also in retraining their workforce or hiring people with practical previous experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So unfortunately Nimrod is not a viable option for companies like Dropbox. Not Nimrod, not any other language. Just like I concluded in &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradha.github.io/articles/2014/04/../03/the-sweet-trap-of-dynamic-languages-and-development-time.html&quot;&gt;my previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the Dropbox team has &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;succeeded&lt;/span&gt; with Python, and now their success is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;killing&lt;/span&gt; them.  Developing a faster interpreter for Python is not a trivial matter, or it would have already been done, so one can only hope that the Dropbox developers &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; know what they are doing starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dropbox/pyston&quot;&gt;Pyston&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe they have tons of money to burn, which offsets nearly any worries a normal programmer has about decision failures.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;The sweet trap of dynamic languages and development time&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.facebook.com/posts/264544830379293/hack-a-new-programming-language-for-hhvm&quot;&gt;Facebook announced Hack, a new programming language for HHVM&lt;/a&gt;. You can read the post yourself, but the summary is they are adding optional static typing to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; language, transforming it in the process. The concept is not exactly new, if you like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python programming language&lt;/a&gt; but require more performance, you can migrate your code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cython.org&quot;&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt;. In both Hack and Cython, final performance is important. If your PHP-like web framework is 100 times faster than &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;Ruby on rails&lt;/a&gt; it means that when you want to scale you need 1/100th of the hardware resources. Anything multiplied by 100 in the scale of Facebook is a lot of money. It's a great deal even if it was only 10 times better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Python very well, and I know Cython as well because I searched for it when I realised how piss poor Python is in terms of computation. If you read Cython's submitted claims of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;my program went faster by 100 times!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, well, they might be true. In my particular case I was processing graphic images with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/&quot;&gt;Python Imaging Library&lt;/a&gt; and required pixel buffer access. Switching to Cython made my little script change from taking 15 minutes to 30 seconds just by virtue of adding a few type definitions here and there. No algorithm change. Also, no matter how much I attempted to optimize the python version I wouldn't even reach close to the improvement of Cython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point I really felt back stabbed. I really liked the language: it was easy to write, fast to develop, source code looked very good. But it failed to deliver. Once I started maintaining large Python source code bases I realised dynamic languages have other traps, like refactoring time and necessary unit testing afterwards, or higher quality requirements for documentation because the programming interface tells you nothing (oh, give me an integer, or a string, or whatever you want, I'll just crash and burn later!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance gains are clear for entities of Facebook scale, but most small or middle size shops may have other pressing issues like time to market, so they choose quick development languages. Do dynamic languages scale? I don't think so, using a dynamic language means that you are only delaying the development cost. Let me explain how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The trap&lt;/h1&gt;

    width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;750&quot;
    hspace=&quot;8pt&quot; vspace=&quot;8pt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a dynamic language is like &lt;a href=&quot;http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force&quot;&gt;the dark side of the force&lt;/a&gt;. Always luring, always tempting. It's easy! It's fast! It's simple! But when your software starts to grow, and you start adding new people to a team, the software crumbles and the dark side enrages you. Suddenly you start devoting an increasingly larger percentage of time to unit testing and fixing your own mistakes. Mistakes which could have been caught if the language didn't make them so easy to do. Mistakes which happen because the API you wrote, you wrote it &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;for yourself&lt;/span&gt;, and when somebody else looks at it, he may have a different opinion on how to use it. Did you write proper documentation? Did you write unit testing for all logic paths? Did you check all parameter inputs to see if they are the correct type?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this is done by a statically compiled language compiler, so instead of unit testing that you are passing a string where you expect there to be an integer, you can unit test real actions done by the user. It's no coincidence that if you look at programming languages, the more unit testing a programming community does (and even prides itself on doing!) the worse the language is at being statically analyzed.  Why require programmers do trivial unit testing when the machine could do it for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most irritating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/span&gt; of dynamic languages is that it is really hard to write well behaved deterministic code if you are a library developer. See this little snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class='code'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;shortestURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSUInteger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;absoluteString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;testShortestURL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;shorty is %@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;shortestURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;URLWithString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.google.es&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;URLWithString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://google.es&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wonder why I chose Objective-C, it's because it is a compiled language, but it behaves like a dynamic language where any object can be anything at any point of time during runtime execution, and for this reason the compiler can't help you. How can this method crash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of passing an NSURL, pass an array of NSString objects. It happens to me a lot of times. Just reading the API doesn't tell you the type of the objects stored in the array. That leads to Objective-C code specifying the type of parameters in the method name, increasing verbosity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you pass an array with a single string, it works! The &lt;code&gt;shortestURL&lt;/code&gt; method could be renamed to &lt;code&gt;magicallyTransformMyTypes&lt;/code&gt;, since the compiler will treat the passed NSString as a returned NSURL, likely ending in a selector crash later when the ninja NSURL object is accessed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being pedantic, you can't even be sure that the &lt;code&gt;urls&lt;/code&gt; parameter is an NSArray. Some JSON code I've seen presumes that the parsed input will return an array, but the JSON could be storing a dictionary. Granted, this is a problem of input validation, but still it happens because most JSON libraries return an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; object instead of an explicit NSDictionary or NSArray, because they don't want to check the type themselves either, leaving the burden on the programmer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens is that a lot of library code ends up with many useless tests to verify that nothing has gone wrong. The language forces you to do the work a compiler would do. Let's see another example in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class='code'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt;#!/bin/usr/env python&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I'm %s, age %d, and speak %s&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Rick&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;English&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we try to run this code we get:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
$ python t.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &amp;quot;t.py&amp;quot;, line 14, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;

    self.age, self.language)
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure is evident, the first parameter to the convenience constructor should be the age and not the name. The number &lt;code&gt;23&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;self.name&lt;/code&gt; and the string &lt;code&gt;Rick&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;self.age&lt;/code&gt;. Hilarity ensues. In a typed language, like C or C++, the compiler is able to scan the format string and detect that you are passing the wrong type. But this is not possible in Python because there is no static type information. This is such a pain that when I write Python code the first line of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;docstring&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/apptaster-to-html/blob/master/apptaster-to-html.py#L21&quot;&gt;the signature of the method with the parameter names replaced as types&lt;/a&gt;. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class='code'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I specify the returned object because you can't be sure either. In Python you can return different types, which is even more fun for programmers calling such functions.  Another case of the programmer hand holding the language. It gets better, though. As user code you can write &lt;code&gt;foo = rick.name&lt;/code&gt; to get the name of the object. What happens if I upgrade the object and rename &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and add a &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;? All the places using the old &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field name will fail. But you won't know until you try. Suddenly when you write code for others you are a prisoner of your initial design, and trying to evolve it is painful process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you think this is something which is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in your hand&lt;/span&gt;, think again. When you write your script and distribute it alone, you are depending on the destination machine/environment to have exactly the same version of the software as you had. This hypothetical other machine could have a different version of one of the modules you use which introduce subtle little bugs, or directly throws exceptions. Talking about exceptions, in dynamic languages you can't be sure either, everything can throw an exception at any moment. In statically compiled languages you can indicate that no exceptions have to be thrown, and if a library you use starts to throw a new one, the compiler will not compile your code until you handle the new exception. Good luck unit testing your software with every possible 3rd party library version forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems with dynamic languages highlight again why unit testing is precious: the programming language is forcing &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; to be the compiler. Why are firms like Facebook &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;adding type information&lt;/span&gt; to a dynamic language rather than writing a static analyzer tool to solve these issues? Surely for such code it would be possible to detect field renames or infer the appropriate types?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/shedskin/&quot;&gt;Shed Skin experimetal Python to C++ compiler&lt;/a&gt;. You read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, a typical speed up of 2-200 times over CPython&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; (that is the normal interpreted Python, has no relation to Cython) and start rubbing your hands. But then you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://shed-skin.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/shed-skin-09.html&quot;&gt;their progress blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and realise it is not a valid solution when it takes 2 minutes to analyze a 3000 line program. Or the fact that this is a restricted version of Python, not every Python code can be ported. Analyzing dynamic language source code to infer the types tends to produces an explosion in compilation time the more complex the source is. There is progress dealing with that, like the Shed Skin compiler shows, but it is still far away from being usable in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The middle ground&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Languages like C++ &lt;a href=&quot;http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html&quot;&gt;are not the solution&lt;/a&gt;, and dynamic languages end up disappointing when you grow past single programmer code. Isn't there a middle ground? There is: instead of patching and old decrepit corpse, start from zero using what you have learned. Start using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod programming language&lt;/a&gt;, which would look like this for the previous examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class='code'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;strutils&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;shortestURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;TUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;TUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;TUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;testShortestURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;shorty is &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;shortestURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;TUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.google.es&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;TUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://google.es&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version in Nimrod is not very idiomatic (e.g. it does not use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org/tut1.html#result-variable&quot;&gt;implicit result variable&lt;/a&gt;), but on top of offering a much cleaner syntax, this version has the advantage of the compiler doing its work: you can't pass an array of strings instead of an array of TUrl objects. If you try you get:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
urls.nim(23, 32) Error: type mismatch: got (seq[string])
but expected one of:
urls.shortestURL(urls: seq[TUrl]): TUrl&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other derived problems from the lack of types of the Objective-C version also disappear in Nimrod. Let's compare to the python snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class='code'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;strutils&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;initMyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;MyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I'm $1, age $2, and speak $3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;initMyFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Rick&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;DecNumber&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;StringLit&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;English&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Operator&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Identifier&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks very close to Python, doesn't it? The differences are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You define the class in a separate &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; section. The methods (called procs in Nimrod) are defined outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like in the previous example, passing the wrong types as parameter won't compile:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
failure.nim(18, 24) Error: type mismatch: got (string, int literal(23), string)
but expected one of:
failure.initMyFailure(age: int, name: string, language: string): MyFailure&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nimrod there is no string formatting which also converts types on the fly. This is a source of bugs, so you are forced to convert all the parameters to strings, hence the usage of the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; operator to convert the integer to a string. If you forget about this, the compiler will remind you:&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;
failure.nim(16, 19) Error: type mismatch: got (int) but expected 'string'&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cracks me up that one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/&quot;&gt;Python mantras&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Explicit is better than implicit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, yet the whole language is implicit about types, so you can pass anything as a string and it will get formatted. You may not get the output you expected, but hey, that's a feature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you rename the field to something else, the compiler won't compile anything until you fix all the places trying to use it. Same thing with exceptions, in Nimrod you declare a proc raises none or a number of exceptions through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org/manual.html#exception-tracking&quot;&gt;raises pragma&lt;/a&gt; and don't worry if a 3rd party library changes the exceptions it raises.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing Nimrod code is not that much different from the Python version. Note how the &lt;code&gt;var rick&lt;/code&gt; line does not specify the type. This reduces source code noise. You can also use &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; to declare a variable which can't change. There is no concept of &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; in Python.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nimrod is very close to a friction free dynamic language in terms of source code writing ease, but it is very performant and sane at the same time.  The advantage of using Nimrod is obvious: you invest only a little bit more of time starting a program with Nimrod due to type declarations and making sure the compiler likes them. But as time goes by you start to reap the rewards compared to dynamic languages. On the other hand, if you start with a dynamic language you are very productive in your first days but on the long run you are plagued with other problems which offset that initial performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, sure, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;it's only for a little script&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;. Haven't you heard of the typical program written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vb6.us&quot;&gt;Visual Basic 6&lt;/a&gt; which is still in use and the company depends on? Dynamic languages might be more tempting to write something quick and easy, but you are risking a lot by doing so. Success can't be killed, yet it may kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">
        &lt;h1&gt;Nimrod for cross platform software&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 21st of February of 2014, Sarah Con… er… &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elhaso.es/seohtracker/ios.en.html&quot;&gt;Seohtracker v4 was released for iOS&lt;/a&gt;. A puny little iOS app. And now the app has crossed the bridge and made it to the Mac App Store as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elhaso.es/seohtracker/osx.en.html&quot;&gt;Seohtracker for OSX&lt;/a&gt;. Why would this be of any relevance? Because both programs are partially implemented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge&quot;&gt;&lt;img
    src=&quot;../../../i/nimrod_doge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Doge is very impressed&quot;

    hspace=&quot;8pt&quot; vspace=&quot;8pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod programming language&lt;/a&gt; compiles pythonesque style code into portable C. Might be more portable than Java. And more machine performant at the low level. And more developer performant at the high level!  And more lisp macros. And… whatever man.  It's just cool, and I believe it is going to allow me to produce real life programs for more platforms with less effort (still working on the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;less effort&lt;/span&gt; part, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nimrod is relatively new and unpopular. Despite the website stating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Nimrod Compiler can also generate C++ or Objective C for easier interfacing&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, there's not much &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;proof&lt;/span&gt; out there you can take as reference. So I decided to start my own, and that's what Seohtracker is. The internal architecture of Seohtracker splits the interface from the logic. Hence, you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-logic&quot;&gt;cross platform logic code&lt;/a&gt; which is implemented in pure Nimrod. Then, somewhere in the middle is floating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-ios/blob/c512307ea505dc7c2262b88ddc8599e94f5f4a74/src/nim/n_global.nim&quot;&gt;thin Nimrod to Obj-C convenience layer&lt;/a&gt; which exposes the Nimrod logic, and finally you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-ios&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-mac&quot;&gt;OSX&lt;/a&gt; clients which are consumers of this API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not write &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt; in Nimrod? That's something I've heard a lot. The most important practical reason is I'm a simple guy doing this on his own, and I can't compare to &lt;a href=&quot;http://xamarin.com&quot;&gt;well paid and full of people firms&lt;/a&gt; doing the wrapping of all the little details. But also because each platform has a different user interface which requires separate design. For instance, the iOS version of Seohtracker is split in multiple view controllers, each reigning its own screen, while the OSX version is pretty much contained in a single root view controller for the main window. Or how about help? The mobile version includes little breadcrumbs of information in certain screens, while the mac version simply lets you go to the index and browse whatever your heart desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is just the beginning! A planned iPad specific user interface already requires a different approach from the iPhone version. But what about Android? And what about Linux? Yes, you can implement a GTK2 version for Linux/Windows too (plus there already are bindings for this toolkit). If you &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; to cram every platform under the same language and graphical toolkit, you are likely to piss off people on each platform, as the result won't be a 100% full citizen compared to the rest of the operating system, just that strange bloke with the weird hair, who hopefully gets the job done, or else… And if you don't use the same graphical toolkit for every platform, well, your bang for the buck for using Nimrod is very reduced, especially because there are only a few low level bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show me the money!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of releasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://praeclarum.org/post/42378027611/icircuit-code-reuse-part-cinq&quot;&gt;some statistics like other projects do&lt;/a&gt;, here are some results of running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/&quot;&gt;SLOCCount&lt;/a&gt; on the iOS, OSX, and logic modules as tagged for the v4 release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SLOCCount actually doesn't support Nimrod, but since the source code and syntax is very similar with regards to line counting, I modified my copy of SLOCCount to treat &lt;code&gt;.nim&lt;/code&gt; files as Python to get immediate results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of lines for Nimrod is really small compared to Objective-C because the logic is small as well, this kind of app is mostly user interface, plus Nimrod is a higher level language than Objective-C. Just starting an Objective-C file from the Xcode template tends to give you a full page chunk of code doing nothing at all. It's not as bad as Java, but still very verbose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason iOS has more lines than OSX is because it is more &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/span&gt;, has more screens, and requires special code to communicate between them. In comparison the OSX version feels like &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradha.github.io/articles/2014/03/../../2013/12/worse-than-global-variables.html&quot;&gt;a global variable with less code overhead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though both the iOS and OSX clients are just interface, instead of shell scripts I used Nimrod through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fowlmouth/nake&quot;&gt;nakefiles&lt;/a&gt; to drive compilation, generate and package the different resources. Think of nakefiles as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-mac/blob/0163927a5e8294c0dc2923f3f3612e36a9b6e389/nakefile.nim&quot;&gt;GNU makefiles on steroids&lt;/a&gt;. That's the reason you see Nimrod lines of code dedicated to them. Nearly none of them do any &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;logic&lt;/span&gt; code in the app the user sees, they are for support. Also, both iOS and OSX nakefiles share some code I haven't yet come to factor, since I was more interested in releasing the OSX version first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately for this comparison I took the repositories as they were tagged for the v4 release. The splitting of Nimrod code from the iOS repository into a separate module &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;happened later&lt;/span&gt;. Which means that the iOS lines of codes for Nimrod are bogus, the current development branch shows just 204 lines of Nimrod code, which goes more in line with the 324 lines of Nimrod code for OS X (the OSX nakefile does more to transform and generate native OSX help files). Anyway, the point here is that reducing the Nimrod lines of code attributed to the iOS client would increase the percentage of native Objective-C code and put it more in line with the OSX version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to the separation of logic vs interface, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-logic/tree/bcb1fb7fec655a0b5714d1e9efd349abb257a6e4/tests&quot;&gt;test suite of the logic module&lt;/a&gt; needs to exist only once. Compare this to current independent mobile developments where different teams develop iOS and Android (sometimes even different code bases for iPhone vs iPad!), each incurring its own share of bugs and odd behaviours. Have you seen firms update their iOS/Android app to leave &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;the other&lt;/span&gt; platform (whatever it might be) picking dust? In my case, the testing can be done once, and from here on for each additional platform I add to the suite I get &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;free time&lt;/span&gt; to spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZC7yA1Cymc&quot;&gt;browsing kpop videos on youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$56,286/year? Seriously? What parallel universe does that come from? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinoria.com/better-software-programmer-doctor/&quot;&gt;more recent articles&lt;/a&gt;, a software developer gets on average $90,060/year. And if you go asking around, it seems like this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;mobile thing&lt;/span&gt; is not a fad, and mobile developers tend to be paid more because there is less of them (and arguably they are worse, because they haven't had the chance to get enough experience in such a short lived field yet). But anyway, how would the cost look like with that higher more recent average? Just multiply by a factor of &lt;code&gt;90,060/56,286 = 1.6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's 16:27 past deadline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about if we measure time? Fortunately I did track all the hours I put into this project so far. Unfortunately, until v4 all the previous iPhone releases had both Objective-C and Nimrod hours lumped, while after v4 most Nimrod hours will go to the logic module. At least we can get more realistic cost estimates. Let's consider a full US work year in neoliberal hours, which clocks at 2088 hours per year.  Using this metric we get that the default average software developer earns 26.96 $/h, while the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;corrected&lt;/span&gt; averaged programmer earns 43.13 $/h (still lower than what I've seen reported on various iOS forums, but let it be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the more realistic average: &lt;code&gt;162.33 * 41.13 = 6676.63$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No kidding, under 4 hours to implement the full logic of the code, split in a nice documented module, all with unit tests? Nah, that was essentially the time it took me to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;extirpate&lt;/span&gt; the code from the iOS repository into the logic repository.  The actual time I have probably spent on the Nimrod code is more in line with 40 hours, which is roughly the total iOS minus the OSX time. This would mean that nearly half of development time was shaved off thanks to Nimrod. Even though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg&quot;&gt;you don't care&lt;/a&gt;, thank you, Nimrod!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seriously, 226,570$ vs 6,676.63$? I know that SLOCCount has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/sloccount.html#cocomo&quot;&gt;a whole lot of documentation which I haven't even tried to read&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to fine tune the estimated cost of the lines of code, but the difference is ridiculous.  People using lines of code to measure anything should be hanged from trees (regardless of proper SLOCCount parameters). The true real cost of this software so far has been approximately one month of an iOS developer. Extrapolate that to whatever local market prices are appropriate for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An experienced OSX developer would have reduced the hour count of 56.42 hours even more. Despite being similar to iOS, OSX has its own share of weird oddities accrued through years of bugs and incorrect API designs. Really, it took me 8 hours to figure out how to correctly generate the OSX help from HTML files. Or 3 hours to find out how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22183622/172690&quot;&gt;keep widgets on top of a scrolling window from leaving artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. Which begs the question: why are your defaults so sucky OSX? &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;WHY?!&lt;/span&gt; Experience on a platform goes a long way towards being productive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Looks like there are no good choices for OSX regarding in-app advertisements like on the mobile platforms. I did take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://buysellads.com&quot;&gt;BuySellAds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://decknetwork.net&quot;&gt;The DECK&lt;/a&gt;, but they are so exclusive they don't answer email or they reject you. So I rolled my own. &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.github.com/gradha/seohtracker-mac/0163927a5e8294c0dc2923f3f3612e36a9b6e389/resources/screenshots/2.png&quot;&gt;Behold the power of marketing!&lt;/a&gt; (right there, in the lower right corner of the left window). Any opportunity is good to make fun of the world for being such a shitty place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The good about using Nimrod&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awesome programming language, free of clutter, easy to write integrated custom builders, compiles and runs at the speed of c (light).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Features like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org/manual.html#exception-tracking&quot;&gt;exception tracking&lt;/a&gt; in the language allow one to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-ios/commit/64252e473bb944f396a66c7bf27ea0fed8f7ea07&quot;&gt;decorate the Nimrod API exported to C&lt;/a&gt; and prevent uncaught Nimrod exceptions from crashing your pretty program. Languages like Ruby or Python require you to write unit tests instead, and depend on your skill to cover all cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write once your logic, or test it once. Works on every platform the same. In fact, I would not write or test in iOS at all! You simply run and debug on your desktop machine, faster, easier, and when everything is all right it just worked on the target platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not specific of Nimrod but of the approach I took, by writing logic separately you force yourself to write better code. I had much satisfaction in ending the OSX client without having to modify a single line of code in the logic module. Writing a logic module like this is more similar to developing a library for other developers than normal applications where you are free to do any number of untold abominations in order to reach your goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Future platforms will come, and I will have nearly zero work to do on them regarding the logic. All users will experience the same quality of software (which depending how you look at it could be bad! Embedded html apps, I'm looking at you).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bad about using Nimrod&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bugs. Prepare to find them and report them. I remember having a week where I'd find one every day.  Which means, you are sometimes forced to write ugly code to work around them (if they can be worked around!). And this means less time working on creating code, more debugging Nimrod.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nimrod is underdeveloped. Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.nimrod-lang.org/t/391&quot;&gt;you report a bug and get a fix some hours later&lt;/a&gt;. But it's more likely that you will hear nothing for days and maybe weeks. Don't plan on using Nimrod (yet) for software you have to deliver on a schedule. You will just end up hating Nimrod.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of which, using a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; compiler version can be tricky. The last official stable version doesn't support all the awesome features in development of the language. The git versions of the compiler may eat your code for breakfast.  Play safe and always keep a log of which git compiler commits did work or not. Store the generated C source safe somewhere, you might need to diff it against newer versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No higher level integration at all with C++/Objective-C features, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/issues/894&quot;&gt;class inheritance&lt;/a&gt;. You can easily import single classes, but they won't have inheritance information, so you can't pass an &lt;code&gt;NSString&lt;/code&gt; to a method which expects any &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, which is like the bread and butter of the Objective-C code. For this reason the logic module has been implemented using the most simple plain C interface. This is quite limiting and I could not implement &lt;code&gt;NSNotification&lt;/code&gt; reporting inside the logic module. Had to do it in the user interface layer, which is &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;wrong&lt;/span&gt; and prone to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have an idea of how to overcome this limitation, but when I tried, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/issues/903&quot;&gt;I found more bugs&lt;/a&gt;. Which is sort of cool, now I &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;think&lt;/span&gt; I have a work around around that bug to work around the class inheritance limitation. If you like solving problems, Nimrod is great!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross-language threading &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.nimrod-lang.org/t/365&quot;&gt;sucks big time&lt;/a&gt;. You can thread in Nimrod. And you can thread in Objective-C. But if you try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyaLZHiJJnE&quot;&gt;cross the streams… total protonic reversal&lt;/a&gt;, meaning your software crashes.  This is a &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;really big&lt;/span&gt; problem with mobile, because essentially everything has to be asynchronous or the user will close your app because it took too long to do something. And you can't call Nimrod code at all from a background thread, so you have to contort your logic/code to funnel on the main thread… somehow. I still haven't figured this out, so all the long operations in Seohtracker are user interface blocking. Fuck users. Good thing I don't have any!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have noticed a pattern here? Lack of developer power, since all of these issues are fixable. A one man language has little to do against projects sponsored by multimillion companies.  And multimillion companies lack the taste to fund a language like Nimrod, so this looks troubling. If you are working on a tight schedule I don't recommend using Nimrod (unless you overestimate like SLOCCount, hah!). If you like tinkering with cool stuff and don't mind getting dirty, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You don't need Nimrod to write software for iOS and OSX&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;True. The astute reader will realize that both platforms use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C&quot;&gt;Objective-C&lt;/a&gt;, a quite ancient crap language (what else can you expect from C?) which only recently (thanks to the iPhone) has been cardiopulmonarily resuscitated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_central_dispatch&quot;&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting&quot;&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt; (don't you love to throw acronyms around to look like you know &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;?) so that programmers from other platforms willing to start writing software for Apple devices manage to get past the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuck_factor&quot;&gt;yuck factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the previous paragraphs I've already outlined the possibilities: the Nimrod logic code is already cross platform, you can grab the compiler and run the test suite on Windows, Mac, Linux and whatever else you are able to run Nimrod. Don't worry, the clients for other platforms will come.  Just no guarantees on a delivery date, being a programmer means you have to master weaseling out of committing to a deadline. So whenever it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first little step. Hopefully it will turn into a long walk and you will be able to witness &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; cross &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;platform-ness&lt;/span&gt;. Who knows, maybe Nimrod will even start to be relevant to Wikipedia? In your dreams…&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">
        &lt;h1&gt;Invoking Dash from the command line Vim&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kapeli.com/dash&quot;&gt;Dash is a documentation browser and snippet manager for macosx&lt;/a&gt; which is much better than Xcode's documentation tool, and also allows one to browse other documentations. You can for instance download &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.nimrod-lang.org/t/330&quot;&gt;a Dash docset for Nimrod&lt;/a&gt; and you will be able to instantly search &lt;a href=&quot;http://nimrod-lang.org&quot;&gt;Nimrod's&lt;/a&gt; documentation. A global keyboard shortcut displays Dash on top of whatever you are doing, you type stuff, then can hide it and continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My editor of choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; as invoked from the terminal command line, either the version which comes with MacOSX or one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org&quot;&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;. Pressing the upper case &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; letter will make Vim invoke the man page viewer for whatever word your cursor is on top of. Wouldn't it be nice to have this integration with Dash too? Here's what I added to my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class='literal'&gt;&amp;quot; Dash integration for objc and nimrod.
command! DashNim silent !open -g dash://nimrod:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;cword&amp;gt;&amp;quot;
command! DashDef silent !open -g dash://def:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;cword&amp;gt;&amp;quot;
nmap K :DashDef&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;\|:redraw!&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;
au FileType nim  nmap K :DashNim&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;\|:redraw!&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I define in these four lines of Vim configuration are two commands, &lt;code&gt;DashNim&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DashDef&lt;/code&gt;. The latter is bound to the upper case &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; letter by default. The former is bound to the same letter but only if the file type of your current Vim buffer is of Nimrod type, which allows for more specific keyword matches.  In Dash I have set up the default docs I search with the &lt;code&gt;def:&lt;/code&gt; shortcut (see Dash's preferences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Dash installed, you can call the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; command passing the &lt;code&gt;dash://&lt;/code&gt; style URL with additional parameters, and there you have it, Vim will query Dash for the word your cursor is on top. The additional &lt;code&gt;redraw&lt;/code&gt; commands are to avoid having to wait to press Enter when the viewer is invoked and to redraw the current screen afterwards. That's because Vim expects the external program to draw stuff on the screen, and by default waits for user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, when you look at Dash's integration preferences, for Vim it points to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rizzatti/dash.vim#readme&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rizzatti/dash.vim#readme&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't manage to get that working, plus I don't understand why I have to install several software packages for what amounts to a few configuration lines in your &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file. Maybe it offers more, but quick lookups are all I need for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Master can't die&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradha.github.io/articles/2014/01/the-tyranny-of-gitflow-defaults.html&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; I suggested renaming repository branch &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; and leave &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; as the development hub. Part was to inform users, and part to detect which software is unable to work with git repositories without a master branch. Well, that did not take long: no git clients on earth work properly if you remove master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official git client comes closest: it &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;works&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;works&lt;/span&gt; means it gets the source code, but lacking a &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch prevents it from populating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;by default&lt;/span&gt; the files in the directory and you are left with the hidden &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; thinking something is not working. So you either have to specify the branch name to checkout during the cloning operation, or check out, get a weird warning, then manually checkout one of the available branches. Other clients like SourceTree seem to refuse to work with the empty repo, or don't know what to do next. I guess checking any branch if &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is not available is too hard for developers to figure out. Or maybe it is part of the git spec?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can't get rid off of &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; unless you want to deal with user support nightmares. So the alternative I'm settling for is to leave &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; as the unstable development branch (goes well with github and most people's expectations), and make git-flow use a &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; branch for software releases. This is essentially the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;inverse&lt;/span&gt; of git-flow defaults: where it creates an extra &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch, I create a &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; branch with reversed meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
